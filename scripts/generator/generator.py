# This script automatically generates the bodies of the following files, creating the full CLBlast API interface and
# implementation (C, C++, and reference BLAS wrappers):
#    clblast.h
#    clblast.cpp
#    clblast_c.h
#    clblast_c.cpp
#    clblast_cuda.h
#    clblast_cuda.cpp

#    clblast_netlib_c.cpp
#    wrapper_clblas.h
#    wrapper_cblas.h
#    pyclblast.pyx
# It also generates the main functions for the correctness and performance tests as found in
#    test/correctness/routines/levelX/xYYYY.cpp
#    test/performance/routines/levelX/xYYYY.cpp
# It also produces the API documentation found in doc/clblast.md
