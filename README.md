CLBlast is a lightweight, performant and tunable OpenCL BLAS library written in C++11. It is designed to leverage the full performance potential of a wide variety of OpenCL devices from different vendors, including desktop and laptop GPUs, embedded GPUs, and other accelerators. CLBlast implements BLAS routines: basic linear algebra subprograms operating on vectors and matrices. See [the CLBlast website](https://cnugteren.github.io/clblast) for performance reports on some devices.

The library is not tuned for all possible OpenCL devices: __if out-of-the-box performance is poor, please run the tuners first__. See [the docs for a list of already tuned devices](doc/tuning.md#already-tuned-for-devices) and [instructions on how to tune yourself](doc/tuning.md) and contribute to future releases of the CLBlast library.


Why CLBlast and not clBLAS or cuBLAS?
-------------

Use CLBlast instead of clBLAS:

* When you care about achieving maximum performance.
* When you want to be able to inspect the BLAS kernels or easily customize them to your needs.
* When you run on exotic OpenCL devices for which you need to tune yourself.
* When you are still running on OpenCL 1.1 hardware.
* When you prefer a C++ API over a C API (C API also available in CLBlast).
* When you value an organized and modern C++ codebase.
* When you target Intel CPUs and GPUs or embedded devices.
* When you can benefit from the increased performance of half-precision fp16 data-types.

Use CLBlast instead of cuBLAS:

* When you want your code to run on devices other than NVIDIA CUDA-enabled GPUs.
* When you want to tune for a specific configuration (e.g. rectangular matrix-sizes).
* When you sleep better if you know that the library you use is open-source.
* When you are using OpenCL rather than CUDA.

When not to use CLBlast:

* When you run on NVIDIA's CUDA-enabled GPUs only and can benefit from cuBLAS's assembly-level tuned kernels.


Getting started
-------------

CLBlast can be compiled with minimal dependencies (apart from OpenCL) in the usual CMake-way, e.g.:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make

Detailed instructions for various platforms can be found are [here](doc/installation.md).

Like clBLAS and cuBLAS, CLBlast also requires OpenCL device buffers as arguments to its routines. This means you'll have full control over the OpenCL buffers and the host-device memory transfers. CLBlast's API is designed to resemble clBLAS's C API as much as possible, requiring little integration effort in case clBLAS was previously used. Using CLBlast starts by including the C++ header:

    #include <clblast.h>

Or alternatively the plain C version:

    #include <clblast_c.h>

Afterwards, any of CLBlast's routines can be called directly: there is no need to initialize the library. The available routines and the required arguments are described in the above mentioned include files and the included [API documentation](doc/api.md). The API is kept as close as possible to the Netlib BLAS and the cuBLAS/clBLAS APIs. For an overview of the supported routines, see [here](doc/routines.md).

To get started quickly, a couple of stand-alone example programs are included in the `samples` subfolder. They can optionally be compiled using the CMake infrastructure of CLBlast by providing the `-DSAMPLES=ON` flag, for example as follows:

    cmake -DSAMPLES=ON ..

Afterwards, you can optionally read more about running proper [benchmarks](doc/benchmarking.md) and [tuning the library](doc/tuning.md).

Known issues
-------------

Known performance related issues:

* Severe performance issues with Beignet v1.3.0 due to missing support for local memory. Please downgrade to v1.2.1 or upgrade to v1.3.1 or newer.

Other known issues:

* Routines returning an integer are currently not properly tested for half-precision FP16: IHAMAX/IHAMIN/IHMAX/IHMIN

* Half-precision FP16 tests might sometimes fail based on order multiplication, i.e. (a * b) * c != (c * b) * a

* The AMD APP SDK has a bug causing a conflict with libstdc++, resulting in a segfault when initialising static variables. This has been reported to occur with the CLBlast tuners.

* The AMD run-time compiler has a bug causing it to get stuck in an infinite loop. This is reported to happen occasionally when tuning the CLBlast GEMM routine.

* AMD Southern Island GPUs might cause wrong results with the amdgpu-pro drivers. Do configure CMake with `AMD_SI_EMPTY_KERNEL_WORKAROUND` to resolve the issue, [see issue #301](https://github.com/CNugteren/CLBlast/issues/301).

* Tests might fail on an Intel IvyBridge GPU with the latest Beignet. Please downgrade Beignet to 1.2.1, [see issue #231](https://github.com/CNugteren/CLBlast/issues/231).
